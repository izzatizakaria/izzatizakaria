<h2>Now, i will tell u about all of my friends that always behind me whenever i have a problems. this is my friend since school again. we met when it was time to enter the high school dorm. at that point everyone still looked innocent and ashamed of each other. after a few months we finally got close and got to know each other's temperament. various happy and sad memories we have gone through together and I really miss it. What is the best is our relationship still remains until now. we will also take the opportunity to get together and go out once. The picture above shows us gathered together and went to Taiping Lake in Perak. we will make sure our relationship will last from school days until now.

Another that, this is my friend from university. I met them on the day of registration for UiTM university. we chatted about university admissions and apparently destined our roommates as well as classmates at the university. the relationship that started from sem1 and until sem 5 in Diploma, we hope this kind of relationship will remains until continue in Degree.

To be honest, it is very sad because all of my friends from primary school are not as close as friends in secondary school and university. In addition, my friends at the school level have lost contact and haven't met anyone else, so this is the only friend of mine who has been with me until now.</h2>
