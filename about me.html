<li>Hey! I’m Izz, and I just started blogging and I’m 21 years old. I love writing and most of my life, I knew that I was going to find a career for myself writing. There were a few missed years (I call them my “try-to-be-practical” years) where I went to college first trying to be a librarian but eventually a career in writing was always in the back of my mind.
